Using a form, present the player with the random emoji and multiple choice options (including the correct name).

Allow the player to submit their guess. Get the data from the form and POST it, using the Fetch API.

Check if the guess is correct and update the player‚Äôs score.

Provide feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess was correct or not.

Continue presenting new emojis and options for the player to guess.

Keep track of the player‚Äôs total score.

Implement a leaderboard to show the top scores.

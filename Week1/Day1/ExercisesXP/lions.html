<h1>The lions</h1>
<hr />

<p>
  Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
  savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than
  other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
  twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
  cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions,
  depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when hunting and
  prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and
  even giraffe.

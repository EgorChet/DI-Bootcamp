        <p>
          Experienced Account Manager transitioning into the tech industry, with
          a focus on Full Stack and Python development. Over 5 years in the FMCG
          and Ad-Tech industries in Russia and the United Kingdom have honed my
          client relationship management and business development skills, with a
          consistent track record of exceeding sales targets and nurturing
          long-term partnerships. Currently, I am expanding my technical
          expertise through a rigorous Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and a Python
          Programming and Data Analysis Course. These courses have equipped me
          with skills in Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, SQL, and
          data visualization tools like Tableau, Seaborn, and Plotly. I am
          actively engaged in practical projects that demonstrate my growing
          proficiency in web development and data analysis, with my work
          available for review on my GitHub profile. My journey into software
          development is fueled by a passion for technology and its potential to
          drive innovation. I am eager to apply my analytical and
          problem-solving skills, honed in my previous roles, to the realm of
          technology. With a unique blend of sales acumen and newly acquired
          technical skills, I am well-positioned to contribute to and grow in a
          Full Stack or Python Developer role. Committed to lifelong learning
          and staying at the forefront of technological advancements, I am
          seeking opportunities to apply my combined expertise in technology and
          client relationship management to drive impactful solutions in the
          tech sector.
